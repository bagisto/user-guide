# Vendor Management

Managing multiple vendors is important for any online marketplace. It helps the platform owner (admin) keep track of all the vendors (sellers), their products, orders, and earnings in an easy and organized manner.

In the Laravel Multi Vendor Marketplace Module, this system is made to be user friendly for vendors and very effective for admins.

Once you log in using your approved seller account, you’ll get access to your seller dashboard where you can easily manage products, view orders, track sales, and update store details.

### Seller Dashboard Overview

Once signed in, sellers land on the Dashboard tab, which gives a clear and quick overview of how their store is performing in real time.

**Key Highlights:**

**1) Overall Details:** View total sales and keep an eye on revenue growth with simple charts and figures.

**2) Top Selling Products:** Instantly see which products are selling the most to plan stock or promotions.
