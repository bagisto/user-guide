[Mutlti-Tenant eCommerce Module](https://store.webkul.com/bagisto-laravel-ecommerce-multi-company-saas.html) in Bagisto allows businesses to build a SaaS-based marketplace platform where multiple vendors or merchants can create and manage their own individual stores under a single system.

Each tenant (merchant) gets a dedicated storefront with complete control over products, categories, orders, and customers, while the platform owner manages the overall infrastructure, subscriptions, and revenue models. This setup reduces operational costs for merchants, as they donâ€™t need to invest in separate eCommerce development or hosting.

### Super Admin Management 

The Super Admin position is the top authority in the SaaS mall, in charge of overseeing tenants, staff, and the entire platform's operations.

This role includes managing merchants (tenants), giving roles to staff (agents), and making sure everything works well together in the system.

Super Admins set up what products are visible, manage channels, and design themes to keep a consistent look and branding for all tenant stores.

They also take care of CMS pages, send out email broadcasts, and manage global settings to ensure clear communication and proper governance of the platform.
