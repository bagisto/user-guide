# Tenant Management

Tenant Management in the SaaS module makes it easy for tenants to sign up and quickly create their online store by filling in their login, personal, and organization information.

After they register, the tenantâ€™s storefront is set up automatically, so they can begin selling immediately without any technical difficulties.

Using the Tenant Admin Panel, tenants can manage products, categories, attributes, customers, and more through a user-friendly interface similar to Bagisto.

Tenants can also manage orders by making invoices, setting up shipments, and using other menu options to run their store efficiently.

### Tenant Registration

There are three steps to register on the SaaS module.

**Step 1:** The Tenant has to enter the Authentication Credentials, like **email, password, and confirm password**, then click on **Continue** button.

### Tenant Storefront

After the registration is done, the tenant's online store is set up automatically.

As you can see in the picture below, this store is the place where customers can look around and buy products.

### Tenant Admin Panel

After registration, tenants can access their admin panel through a unique URL (e.g., **site1.bagisto.com/saas-common/admin/dashboard**). 

As shown in the image below, the panel provides a Bagisto-like backend where tenants can manage their store operations.

Apart from **products**, tenants can also create and manage **categories, attributes, and attribute families** to organize their store efficiently.

### Manage Profile Details

Under the Tenant side menu, tenants have the ability to manage and change their profile details. They can modify information like:

**1) First Name and Last Name**

**2) Email address**

**3) Skype ID**

**4) cName**

**5) Phone number**
