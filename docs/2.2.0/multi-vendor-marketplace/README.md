# Multi Vendor Marketpace

Bagistoâ€™s Marketplace Module transforms a standard store into a complete marketplace, allowing the admin to manage sellers, commissions, product approvals, and order handling, while giving vendors a dedicated dashboard to manage their catalog, orders, and transactions. 

### Vendor Management

Managing multiple vendors is important for any online marketplace. It helps the platform owner (admin) keep track of all the vendors (sellers), their products, orders, and earnings in an easy and organized manner.

In the Multi Vendor Marketplace Module, this system is made to be user friendly for vendors and very effective for admins.

### Orders management 

Order management in a Multi Vendor Marketplace helps sellers and admins track, manage, and fulfill customer orders with ease. 

From the moment a buyer places an order to shipping and delivery, everything is handled in one place.
 
It ensures smooth processing, timely updates, and better coordination between vendors and buyers for a hassle free shopping experience.

### Commission Management

The Marketplace Commission Management system in Bagisto lets platform owners (admins) set and manage commission rates for sellers in a flexible and clear way.

This system helps the marketplace earn steady income, and it also gives admins the ability to give special commission rates to sellers as rewards or incentives when necessary.
