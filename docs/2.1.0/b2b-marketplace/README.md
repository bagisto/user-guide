[B2B Marketplace Module](https://store.webkul.com/laravel-b2b-marketplace.html) is an advanced solution that transforms your store into a complete wholesale and B2B commerce platform. It enables businesses to manage bulk orders, negotiate pricing, and streamline procurement between buyers, suppliers, and distributors.

With features like RFQ (Request for Quote), tiered pricing, customer-specific catalogs, and vendor management, the B2B Marketplace offers flexibility and scalability for manufacturers, wholesalers, and enterprises. It combines the power of open-source with enterprise-ready tools to deliver a seamless B2B buying experience.

### Request for Quotes

Request for Quotes (RFQ) in a B2B marketplace helps buyers ask sellers for prices before placing an order. Instead of placing an order directly, buyers can send a detailed quote request with their requirements, and sellers respond with tailored offers. 

This makes it easier to compare prices, negotiate, and choose the right deal. 

### Buyer Seller Communication

Buyer and Seller communication in a B2B Marketplace ensures smooth and transparent interactions. Buyers can send messages, negotiate prices, and discuss product details, while sellers respond with offers, updates, and order information. 

It builds strong relationships while keeping both parties clear and coordinated before closing.
