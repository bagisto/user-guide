# Inventory Source

Multi-Warehouse Inventory is one of the unique features of Bagisto. Here we will explain how you can manage multi-warehouse inventory in Laravel eCommerce and provide reliable service to your customer. Having a single inventory source can pose some restrictions for your eCommerce store.

For instance, suppose you have only one inventory in Delhi. A Customer from Chennai has ordered some products. So delivering that product from the Delhi location can have some impacts like delay in delivery of the product, increased transportation cost, etc. However, if you have an inventory in Chennai, then the product will reach the customer very quickly which will further cut down the time and shipping cost. 

By using Multi-Warehouse Inventory you can easily manage all inventory sources. In Bagisto, you can create as many inventory sources and easily manage them.
