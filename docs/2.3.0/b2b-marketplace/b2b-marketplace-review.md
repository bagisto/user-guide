# B2B Marketplace Review

The Review feature allows buyers to share their experience with sellers in the marketplace. It is designed to build trust and make buying decisions easier.

1) Buyers can rate sellers based on service quality, communication, and reliability.

2) Reviews help other buyers choose the right seller with confidence.

3) Sellers can use reviews to gain credibility and improve their services.

This feature creates a transparent B2B marketplace where genuine feedback supports better business relationships.

**Note: Reviews can only be given by logged in customers after their product has been successfully delivered.**

### How to Submit a Review
