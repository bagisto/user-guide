# Buying leads

In a B2B marketplace, buying leads is a smart way for businesses to connect with genuine buyers. Instead of waiting for customers to find you, leads bring ready to buy opportunities straight to your business. 

This saves time, increases sales chances, and helps sellers grow faster in a competitive market.

**Note:** Buying Leads are generated when customers submit an RFQ.

### Seller: Buying Leads

To start the buying leads process, the seller needs to log in to their Seller Dashboard.
