# Request for Quotes

Request for Quotes (RFQ) in a B2B marketplace helps buyers ask sellers for prices before placing an order. Instead of placing an order directly, buyers can send a detailed quote request with their requirements, and sellers respond with tailored offers. 

This makes it easier to compare prices, negotiate, and choose the right deal. 

**Note:** RFQ feature can only be used by signed in customers.

### Create Request for Quotes
