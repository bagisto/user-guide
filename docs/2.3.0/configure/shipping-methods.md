# Shipping Methods

To deliver the products there are two types of shipping methods.

To add go to the Admin Panel and click on **Configure >> Shipping Methods**

**1) Free Shipping** "Free shipping" refers to a shipping method where the cost of shipping is waived, and the seller covers the shipping expenses for delivering goods to the buyer.

**2)Flat Rate Shipping** Flat rate shipping is a shipping method where a fixed fee is charged for shipping, regardless of the weight, size, or distance of the package. This simplifies shipping costs and can be advantageous for both buyers and sellers.
