# Marketing 

Marketing is a method of promoting a business that sells its products or services through the Internet. The goals of eCommerce marketing are driving traffic to the online store, converting visitors to paying customers and retaining them after a purchase.

E-commerce marketing consists of activities that guide online shoppers through the conversion.

### Promotion Rules

Promotion is when you offer sales and discounts to online shoppers to get new customers and increase revenue. And more importantly, these promotions can turn new visitors into loyal customers and repeat buyers.

### Communications

Constant communication with the customer, especially after they have made a purchase, about their order status, delivery status, product warranty, how to use explainer videos, ongoing or upcoming offers and discounts, and sharing personalized cross-sell product offers consequently has proven to be a good strategy.

### Sitemaps

Sitemaps inform search engines which pages on a website should be crawled, and may help search engines discover and index those pages. While sitemaps can be a simple text file listing the URLs of all of the pages you'd like to have indexed, they can also be an XML document carrying more information.
