# Attribute Input Type

Attributes can have different input types that determine not only how you enter the values for the attribute, but also how shoppers can select attributes in the case of options, or enter values.

Product Attributes are a set of characteristics that define a particular product or a group of goods. This means size, color, flavor, package type, etc. constitute attributes. Product attributes are not just about the general description of a product, but they speak about the value of products that makes it unique.
