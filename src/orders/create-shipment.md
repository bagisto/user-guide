# Create Shipment

Shipment is a process whereby goods are shipped using the Internet as the primary means of communication. 

It is a convenient way of shipping for both consumers and businesses alike, as it offers a quick and easy way to send items from one location to another.

“Shipping” denotes the processing, packaging, and dispatching of small items that can be sent quickly and easily, typically through a local courier service.
