# Taxes

**A) Tax Categories**  
Tax categories are classifications for different types of taxes, such as sales tax, value-added tax, or excise tax, used to categorize and apply tax rates to products or services.

To configure, go to the Admin Panel and click on **Configure >> Taxes**.

**B) Calculation Settings**  
Calculation settings define how product pricing and taxes are applied.

### Calculation Based On
By default, there are 3 options for calculations: Shipping Address, Billing Address, Shipping Origin.

**A) Shipping Address**  
A shipping address is the location where goods are sent for delivery, including recipient name, street, city, state, postal/ZIP code, etc.

**B) Billing Address**  
A billing address is linked to the payment method and is used for verification.

**C) Shipping Origin**  
Shipping origin refers to the location from which products are dispatched.  
This information is important for shipment tracking, calculating shipping costs, and estimating delivery times.
