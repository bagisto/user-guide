The storefront serves as the customer-facing component of an online store, featuring product displays, category listings, and intuitive navigation to ensure a smooth and enjoyable shopping experience.

To add, go to Admin Panel and click on **Configure >> Products >> Storefront**.

**1. Search Mode:** Select the search mode by **Database or Elasticsearch** as per your requirements.

**A) Elastic Search** – When you have a large number of products on your website, searching can be slow. Elastic Search mode enables fast product search.

**B) Database** – Recommended for websites with a small number of products; use the database option for search mode.

**2. Default List Mode:** Manage how your products are visible on the storefront; select from the dropdown **Grid or List**.
