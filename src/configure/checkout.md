### My Cart

Enable settings for My Cart to show a summary of item quantities and display the total number of items in the cart for easy tracking.

In this, we provide two options:

**A) Display numbers of items in cart** - Select **Display number of items in cart** option and then click on **Save Configuration** button.

After clicking the Add to Cart button, this option shows you the total number of quantities. For example, we add 5 products inside the cart. 5 products will be visible on the front end as shown below.

**B) Display Items Quantities** - Select Display items quantities option and then click on **Save Configuration** button.

After clicking the Add to Cart button, for example, 7 products you have added inside the cart, only 1 quantity will be visible on the frontend.

To check the total number of items, you have to go inside the mini-cart.

### Mini Cart

Mini Cart is the option where you can see the information after adding the product to the cart.

To enable mini cart settings, go to **Configure >> Checkout >> Mini Cart**. You can also add a mini cart offer information message as shown in the image below.

The mini cart is able to open with an offer message as shown in the image below.

Now, if we disable this Mini-Cart, the user is not able to open the mini-cart and is directly redirected to the checkout page.
