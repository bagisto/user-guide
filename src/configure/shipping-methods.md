# Shipping Methods

To deliver products, Bagisto provides two types of shipping methods.  
To configure, go to the Admin Panel and navigate to **Configure >> Shipping Methods**.

### 1) Free Shipping

Free shipping is a method where the cost of shipping is waived, and the seller covers the shipping expenses for delivering goods to the buyer.

### 2) Flat Rate Shipping

Flat rate shipping is a method where a fixed fee is charged for shipping, regardless of weight, size, or distance of the package. This simplifies shipping costs and benefits both buyers and sellers.
