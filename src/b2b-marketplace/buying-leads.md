# Buying Leads

In a B2B marketplace, **buying leads** is a smart way for businesses to connect with genuine buyers. Instead of waiting for customers to find you, leads bring ready-to-buy opportunities straight to your business. This saves time, increases sales chances, and helps sellers grow faster in a competitive market.

**Note:** Buying Leads are generated when customers submit an RFQ.

### Seller: Buying Leads

To start the buying leads process, the seller needs to log in to their **Seller Dashboard**.

### Each RFQ Shows the Following Details:

- **1) Product Name:** Shows the item the buyer is requesting.
- **2) Quantity:** Displays how many units the buyer needs.
- **3) Price:** Indicates the buyer’s expected or offered price.
- **4) Category:** Defines the product’s category.
- **5) Posted By (Buyer):** Shows which buyer raised the RFQ.
- **6) Location:** Tells where the buyer is located.

The seller can select an RFQ, send a quote with pricing, and message the customer to discuss or negotiate details.

Click the **“Message”** button to open a message box, then write your message and click **“Send”** to share it with the customer and discuss their requirements.
