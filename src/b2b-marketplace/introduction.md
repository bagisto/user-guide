# B2B Marketplace 

[B2B Marketplace](https://bagisto.com/en/laravel-b2b-marketplace/) is an advanced solution that transforms your store into a complete wholesale and B2B commerce platform. It enables businesses to manage bulk orders, negotiate pricing, and streamline procurement between buyers, suppliers, and distributors.

With features like RFQ (Request for Quote), tiered pricing, customer-specific catalogs, and vendor management, the B2B Marketplace offers flexibility and scalability for manufacturers, wholesalers, and enterprises. It combines the power of open-source with enterprise-ready tools to deliver a seamless B2B buying experience.

### Request for Quotes

Request for Quotes (RFQ) in a B2B marketplace helps buyers ask sellers for prices before placing an order. Instead of placing an order directly, buyers can send a detailed quote request with their requirements, and sellers respond with tailored offers. 

This makes it easier to compare prices, negotiate, and choose the right deal. 

### Buyer Seller Communication

Buyer and Seller communication in a B2B Marketplace ensures smooth and transparent interactions. Buyers can send messages, negotiate prices, and discuss product details, while sellers respond with offers, updates, and order information. 

It builds strong relationships while keeping both parties clear and coordinated before closing.

### Supplier Microsite 

The Supplier Microsite in Bagisto B2B Marketplace is like a mini online store for each supplier. It lets suppliers showcase their brand, products, company details, and policies in one place.

Buyers can visit the microsite to explore products, request quotes, or place orders directly. This helps suppliers build trust, promote their business, and reach more customers easily.

### Buying leads

In a B2B marketplace, buying leads is a smart way for businesses to connect with genuine buyers. Instead of waiting for customers to find you, leads bring ready to buy opportunities straight to your business. 

This saves time, increases sales chances, and helps sellers grow faster in a competitive market.

### B2B Marketplace Review

The Review feature allows buyers to share their experience with sellers in the marketplace. It is designed to build trust and make buying decisions easier.
