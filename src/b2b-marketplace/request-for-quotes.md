# Request for Quotes

**Request for Quotes (RFQ)** in a B2B marketplace helps buyers ask sellers for prices before placing an order. Instead of placing an order directly, buyers can send a detailed quote request with their requirements, and sellers respond with tailored offers. This makes it easier to compare prices, negotiate, and choose the right deal.

**Note:** The RFQ feature can only be used by signed-in customers.

### Create Request for Quotes

To begin using the RFQ feature, customers need to sign in to their account. Just click on the profile icon at the top right corner of the page.
