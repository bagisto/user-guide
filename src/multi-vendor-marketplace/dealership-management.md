# Dealership Management

The Dealership Management system lets marketplace sellers add products that already exist in the store catalog, created by the admin. 

Instead of building every product from scratch, dealers can simply pick items from the master catalog and publish them with their own price, stock, and details.

This makes listing faster, keeps product information consistent, and reduces the effort needed to start selling.

Dealers can also perform product listing from global catalog, making it simple to list products that already exist in the marketplace system.

### Vendor Listing from Central Catalog

The Vendor Listing feature lets customers view all sellers in one place.

Each vendor is shown with important details like the store name, logo, address, ratings, and number of reviews. 

This makes it easier for buyers to find and explore different sellers in the marketplace.

Customers can click on any vendor to open their store page, where they can view all products, read reviews, and check the complete seller information.

This helps build trust and gives vendors more visibility to attract buyers and increase sales.
