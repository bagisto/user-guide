# Dealership Management

The Dealer Management system allows dealers to sell products that are already available in the marketplace, added by the Admin.

Instead of creating a new listing from scratch, dealers can perform Product Listing from Global Catalog, customize their price, quantity, product condition, and add a new description.

This feature helps dealers save time by reusing existing product listings and ensuring consistency across the marketplace, and supporting List Existing Catalog Product functionality.

### Dealership Guide: Adding Existing Products

From the seller dashboard, go to Products and click on it to open the product page.

**Note:** Once the admin reviews and approves it, the status will change to **Approved**, and only then will the product be visible on the store frontend.

### Admin Panel: Manage Products Added by Dealers

From the Admin Dashboard, the admin has the authority to approve or disapprove products created by dealers. Only approved products will appear on the storefront.

This process allows the admin to Assign Product from Master Catalog and ensure all dealer listings maintain consistent data quality.


Go to **Marketplace >> Products** to view and manage all your products from the seller dashboard.
