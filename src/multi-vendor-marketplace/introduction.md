# Multi Vendor Marketpace 

[Multi Vendor Marketplace](https://bagisto.com/en/laravel-multi-vendor-marketplace/) transforms a standard store into a complete marketplace, allowing the admin to manage sellers, commissions, product approvals, and order handling, while giving vendors a dedicated dashboard to manage their catalog, orders, and transactions. 

### Vendor Management

Managing multiple vendors is important for any online marketplace. It helps the platform owner (admin) keep track of all the vendors (sellers), their products, orders, and earnings in an easy and organized manner.

In the Multi Vendor Marketplace, this system is made to be user friendly for vendors and very effective for admins.

### Dealership Management

The Dealer Management system allows dealers to sell products that are already available in the marketplace, added by the Admin.

Instead of creating a new listing from scratch, dealers can use existing products added by the Admin, customize their price, quantity, product condition, and add a new description.

This feature helps dealers save time by reusing existing product listings and maintaining consistent product information across the marketplace.

### Orders management 

Order management in a Multi Vendor Marketplace helps sellers and admins track, manage, and fulfill customer orders with ease. 

From the moment a buyer places an order to shipping and delivery, everything is handled in one place.
 
It ensures smooth processing, timely updates, and better coordination between vendors and buyers for a hassle free shopping experience.

### Commission Management

The Marketplace Commission Management system in Bagisto lets platform owners (admins) set and manage commission rates for sellers in a flexible and clear way.

This system helps the marketplace earn steady income, and it also gives admins the ability to give special commission rates to sellers as rewards or incentives when necessary.

### Product Management

In Multi Vendor Marketplace, Product management is designed to give sellers complete control over their online store. It allows sellers to easily add new products, set prices, upload images, and update stock.

With easy to use tools, sellers can quickly edit or update products whenever needed, making sure their listings stay accurate and attractive. 

### Rating Management

Ratings and reviews build trust in an online marketplace, guide customer purchases, and help sellers improve their service.

In a Laravel Multi Vendor Marketplace, Rating Management allows buyers to leave star ratings and detailed feedback on both products and sellers after completing a purchase.

### Payment Management 

Payment management in a Multi-Vendor Marketplace helps both sellers and admins handle finances with ease and clarity. Sellers can quickly check their earnings, see payment details for orders, and request payouts without hassle. 

Admins can easily track all payments, manage commissions, and make sure settlements are secure and on time.
