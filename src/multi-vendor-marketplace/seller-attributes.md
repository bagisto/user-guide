# Seller Attributes

Seller Attributes are custom fields created by the admin to collect additional information about sellers, beyond basic details.

These attributes help store specific seller data such as shop details, contact information, or business related fields.

The admin decides which seller attributes must be filled out and where they show up, like during seller registration or in the seller's profile.

Sellers complete these attributes when they sign up or update their profile, depending on what the admin has set up.

Seller attributes help organize seller profiles better and let the marketplace show important seller information clearly.
