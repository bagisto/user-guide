# Rating Management

Ratings and reviews build trust in an online marketplace, guide customer purchases, and help sellers improve their service.

In a Laravel Multi Vendor Marketplace, **Rating Management** allows buyers to leave star ratings and detailed feedback on both products and sellers after completing a purchase. Good ratings boost credibility, while honest feedback (even if negative) guides sellers to improve.

---

### Product Rating

1. Customers can give a star rating and write feedback about the product they bought.
2. This helps other buyers understand whether the product is of good quality and worth purchasing.
3. Products with higher ratings usually attract more customers, as they signal trust and satisfaction.

---

### Seller Rating

1. After receiving an order, customers can rate and review the seller.
2. This shows whether the seller is reliable, responsive, and delivers on time.
3. Positive ratings help sellers build a strong reputation, while constructive feedback allows them to improve their service.

**Note:** The Ratings and Reviews feature can only be used by signed-in customers. Guest users are not allowed to give ratings or reviews.
