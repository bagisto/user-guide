# B2B eCommerce Platform

[B2B eCommerce Platform](https://bagisto.com/en/b2b-commerce-platform/) is an open-source solution that adds advanced Business-to-Business features to the Bagisto eCommerce platform. It helps companies manage corporate accounts, bulk orders, and team access with ease.

It is designed to simplify B2B operations by allowing companies to register, manage users, and handle purchasing from a single dashboard.

With tools like quick order, requisition lists, and request-for-quote (RFQ), it makes the buying process faster and more organized for business customers.

Role-based permissions let companies assign roles and control access, ensuring a secure and well-managed workflow across all users.

The B2B Suite is ideal for wholesalers, manufacturers, and distributors looking to run a scalable, flexible, and efficient B2B online store.
