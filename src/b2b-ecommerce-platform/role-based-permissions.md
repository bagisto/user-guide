# Role Based Permissions

The Role-Based Permissions feature allows companies to create custom roles and define what each user can access within the organization. 

This helps ensure that each user only has access to the features relevant to their responsibilities.

The **Company Roles** page will appear, showing all existing roles with options to search, filter, or manage them.
