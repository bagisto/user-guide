# Sitemaps

Sitemaps inform search engines which pages on a website should be crawled, and may help search engines discover and index those pages. 

While sitemaps can be a simple text file listing the URLs of all the pages you'd like to have indexed, they can also be an XML document carrying more information.

## Step 1: Add New Sitemap

On the Admin panel, go to **Marketing > Search & SEO > Sitemaps** and click on **Create Sitemap** as shown below.

<ImagePopup src="/images/marketing/createSitemap.png" alt="Search Field" />

## Step 2: Configure Sitemap

Add the **File Name** and **File Path**, then click the **Save Sitemap** button.

Make sure you have created an **XML file** and mentioned its correct path as shown below.

<ImagePopup src="/images/marketing/saveSitemap.png" alt="Search Field" />

## Step 3: View Sitemap

Now you will be able to see the newly created **Sitemap** as shown below.

<ImagePopup src="/images/marketing/sitemapOutput.png" alt="Search Field" />

By this, you can easily create a **Sitemap** in Bagisto.
