# Sitemaps

Sitemaps inform search engines which pages on a website should be crawled, and may help search engines discover and index those pages. 

While sitemaps can be a simple text file listing the URLs of all the pages you'd like to have indexed, they can also be an XML document carrying more information.

## Step 1: Add New Sitemap

On the Admin panel, go to **Marketing > Search & SEO > Sitemaps** and click on **Create Sitemap** as shown below.
