### Step 2: Set Conditions

All condition in the catalog rule is based on the product attribute. If you want to apply the rule on all products don’t set any condition. Set the condition type to all conditions that are true or any condition that is true.

**1. Actions Type:-** You can apply a discount on a percentage basis or a fixed amount basis.

**2. Discount Amount:-** Enter discount amount.

**3. End Other Rules:-** To stop applying other rules after this rule applies set “Yes”. This will work for applying multiple discounts on the same product.

**Note:- If you want multiple rules to apply to the product then set “NO”. So in that case the rule which has the highest priority will apply first.**

Now **Save the Catalog Rule** and you will able to see a new **Catalog Rule** is been created successfully.
