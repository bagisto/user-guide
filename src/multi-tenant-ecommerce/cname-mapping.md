# CName Mapping

**CName Mapping** lets tenants connect their own domain to the subdomain created by the SaaS, which helps with professional branding.

When a tenant signs up, a default subdomain like **username.rootdomain.com** is created. With CNAME, their actual domain can be directed to this subdomain. This makes it easy for customers to find the store and keeps a reliable, consistent online image.

The mapping is set up through the tenant's DNS provider and the SaaS by the **Super Admin**, and it doesn't need any extra plugins.

## Flow to Map Tenant Domain with CNAME

### Step 1: Login to DNS Console

Log in to your DNS provider (like GoDaddy) and go to the settings for the domain you want to map.

### Step 2: Add DNS Record

Once you log in, set up an **A record** for your domain that directs to the IP of the SaaS server.

For example, to map the domain **myshopdemo.com** with the SaaS server **IP: 206.189.131.29**, add an **A record** in your DNS settings as shown in the image below.

### Step 3: Configure CNAME in SaaS

After mapping the domain with the server IP, log in as **Super Admin** in the SaaS. You will see the tenant’s subdomain already created (e.g., **site1.bagisto.com**).

To map the tenant’s real domain (e.g., **myshopdemo.com**), click the **edit (pencil) icon**, enter the domain in the **CNAME** field, and then click **Save Tenant** to save.

### Step 4: Test the Domain

Open the tenant's website in a browser and see if it loads properly.

If the website loads on the tenant's original domain (like **myshopdemo.com**), it means the connection with the SaaS subdomain worked successfully.
