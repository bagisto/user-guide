# Tenant Management

**Tenant Management** in the SaaS makes it easy for tenants to sign up and quickly create their online store by filling in their login, personal, and organization information.

After registration, the tenant’s storefront is set up automatically, allowing them to begin selling immediately without any technical difficulties.

Using the **Tenant Admin Panel**, tenants can manage products, categories, attributes, customers, and more through a user-friendly interface similar to Bagisto. Tenants can also manage orders by creating invoices, setting up shipments, and using other menu options to run their store efficiently.

## Tenant Registration

There are three steps to register on the SaaS:

### Step 1
The tenant must enter the **Authentication Credentials**, such as:
- **Email**

- **Confirm Password**

Then, click on the **Continue** button.

## Tenant Admin Panel

After registration, tenants can access their admin panel through a unique URL (e.g., **site1.bagisto.com/saas-common/admin/dashboard**).

As shown in the image below, the panel provides a **Bagisto-like backend** where tenants can manage their store operations.
