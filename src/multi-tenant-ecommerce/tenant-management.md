# Tenant Management

**Tenant Management** in the SaaS makes it easy for tenants to sign up and quickly create their online store by filling in their login, personal, and organization information.

After registration, the tenantâ€™s storefront is set up automatically, allowing them to begin selling immediately without any technical difficulties.

Using the **Tenant Admin Panel**, tenants can manage products, categories, attributes, customers, and more through a user-friendly interface similar to Bagisto. Tenants can also manage orders by creating invoices, setting up shipments, and using other menu options to run their store efficiently.

## Tenant Registration

There are three steps to register on the SaaS:

### Step 1
The tenant must enter the **Authentication Credentials**, such as:
- **Email**
- **Password**
- **Confirm Password**

Then, click on the **Continue** button.

## Tenant Admin Panel

After registration, tenants can access their admin panel through a unique URL (e.g., **site1.bagisto.com/saas-common/admin/dashboard**).

As shown in the image below, the panel provides a **Bagisto-like backend** where tenants can manage their store operations.

Apart from **products**, tenants can also create and manage:
