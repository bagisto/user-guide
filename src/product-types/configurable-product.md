# Configurable Product

Configurable products are items or services that offer customers the flexibility to personalize certain attributes according to their preferences. Whether in manufacturing, e-commerce, or software, these products enable users to choose from predefined options, such as features, specifications, colors, or sizes.

This customization allows for a diverse range of variations without the need for creating unique products. Configurable products are designed to meet individual needs, enhancing customer satisfaction and providing a tailored experience in [Bagisto](https://bagisto.com/en/).
