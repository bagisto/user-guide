# Simple Product

A **simple product** is a product type in e-commerce that does not require customers to choose additional attributes (such as size or color) to add to the cart. It should be a physical item and can be shipped to customers.

Therefore, any service, such as downloadable items, does not count as a simple product. This is the step-by-step tutorial on how to add a simple product in [Bagisto](https://bagisto.com/en/).
