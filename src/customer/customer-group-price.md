**Fixed Price Example**  

Here I have set the fixed price of the product in the **Guest Customer group** with a minimum quantity of 1.  

It means if you purchase 1 piece of this product at $500, then for guest users, the cost will be $400.  

So now click on the **Save** button as shown below.

Now save the product. You can see the price change according to the group.  

As set for the Guest group with the fixed price, it is showing the pricing according to the guest group as shown below.
