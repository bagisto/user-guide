to &quot;Commission Management&quot;">​</a></h1><p>The Marketplace Commission Management system in Bagisto lets platform owners (admins) set and manage commission rates for sellers in a flexible and clear way.</p><p>This system helps the marketplace earn steady income, and it also gives admins the ability to give special commission rates to sellers as rewards or incentives when necessary.</p><p>There are three main parts to commission handling:</p><p><strong>1) Admin Commission Percentage (Global Rate)</strong></p><p><strong>2) Seller Commission (Custom Rate)</strong></p><p><strong>3) Sales Reporting for Transparency</strong></p><h3 id="admin-commission-percentage-global-rate" tabindex="-1">Admin Commission Percentage (Global Rate) <a class="header-anchor" href="#admin-commission-percentage-global-rate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Admin Commission Percentage (Global Rate)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A global commission rate is a standard percentage that automatically applies to all sellers.</p><p>This is the easiest and most reliable way to make money from sales since every seller on the platform pays the same rate.</p><p><strong>Why it’s important:</strong></p><ol><li>Makes sure that all sellers are treated fairly and equally.</li><li>Simple to handle — there&#39;s no need to set up separate commissions unless it&#39;s necessary.</li><li>Supports keeping a steady income for the marketplace.</li></ol><p><strong>Steps to set the global commission</strong></p><ol><li>In the Admin Panel, go to <strong>Configure → Marketplace → General</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Admin Commission Percentage</strong> field.</li><li>Enter the percentage rate you want to apply globally.</li><li>Click <strong>Save Configuration</strong> — the rate will now be applied automatically to all sellers.</li></ol><img src="'+i+'" alt="Global Commission Configuration"><p><strong>Example:</strong><br> If the global rate is 10%, and a seller sells something for $1,000, the admin will automatically get $100 as their commission, while the seller keeps $900.</p><hr><h3 id="seller-commission-custom-rate" tabindex="-1">Seller Commission (Custom Rate) <a class="header-anchor" href="#seller-commission-custom-rate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Seller Commission (Custom Rate)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At times, you might want to establish a unique commission rate for specific sellers.</p><p>This is called a custom commission rate and it can be either higher or lower than the overall rate, based on the agreement.</p><p><strong>When to use a custom commission:</strong></p><ol><li>To motivate new sellers by offering them lower commission rates.</li><li>As a bonus for sellers who perform really well.</li><li>For unique partnership deals.</li><li>For short-term promotions or boosts during seasonal sales.</li></ol><p><strong>Key feature:</strong></p><ol><li>Status Toggle can enable or disable a custom commission anytime.</li><li>When it&#39;s on, the custom commission takes the place of the global commission for that specific seller.</li><li>When disabled, the seller returns to the global rate.</li></ol><p><strong>How to set a custom commission for a seller:</strong></p><ol><li>In the Admin Panel, go to: <strong>Marketplace → Sellers</strong>.</li><li>Find the seller you want to edit and click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Seller Commission</strong> section.</li><li>Enter the desired rate and use the <strong>Status Toggle</strong> to turn it ON.</li><li>Save the settings — the custom rate will now apply only to that seller.</li></ol><img src="'+l+'" alt="Seller Custom Commission"><p><strong>Example:</strong><br> If the global rate is 10%, but Seller A is given a custom rate of 5%, only 5% will be deducted from Seller A’s sales, while others continue to be charged 10%.</p><hr><h3 id="sales-reporting-for-transparency" tabindex="-1">Sales Reporting for Transparency <a class="header-anchor" href="#sales-reporting-for-transparency" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sales Reporting for Transparency&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Bagisto has a built-in sales reporting tool that allows sellers to easily track how much commission they have paid over time.</p><p>This openness helps create trust between the marketplace and sellers by making sure there are no secret fees.</p><p><strong>Benefits of sales reporting:</strong></p><ol><li>Sellers can track their total commission paid to the admin.</li><li>Provides insights into how commissions impact overall profits.</li><li>Encourages healthy business relationships through openness.</li></ol><p><strong>Where sellers can find this report:</strong></p><ol><li>From the <strong>Seller Dashboard</strong>, navigate to: <strong>Reporting → Total Commission Paid</strong>.</li></ol><img src="'+n+'" alt="Total Commission Paid Reporting"><p><strong>Example:</strong><br> A seller selling $50,000 worth of goods at a 10% commission rate will see $5,000 listed in the “Total Commission Paid” section.</p>',38)]))}const b=s(r,[["render",m]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
